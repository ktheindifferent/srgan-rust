## Summary

The SRGAN-Rust project has solid foundations but requires significant work to achieve production readiness. The most critical issues are:

1. **102 unwrap() calls** that will crash the application
2. **Non-functional GPU acceleration** misleading users
3. **Incomplete model converter** with placeholder code
4. **Poor error handling** in web server and video processing

With focused effort over 6 weeks, these issues can be resolved, transforming SRGAN-Rust into a robust, production-ready image upscaling solution.

**Total Estimated Effort**: 150 developer hours (6 weeks, 1-2 developers)

**Critical Path**: Error Handling → GPU Decision → Feature Completion → Monitoring
