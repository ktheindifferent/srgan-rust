# SRGAN-Rust Project Description

## Project Overview
SRGAN-Rust is a Rust implementation of Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGAN) for image upscaling using deep learning. The project provides both pre-trained neural networks for immediate use and the ability to train custom networks on specialized datasets.

## Current Features
- **Image Upscaling**: Uses neural networks to upscale low-resolution images to high-resolution
- **Pre-trained Models**: Includes natural and anime-specific models
- **Custom Training**: Ability to train new models on custom datasets
- **Multiple Commands**: Support for training, upscaling, downscaling, PSNR calculation, and more
- **Flexible Parameters**: Configurable learning rates, batch sizes, patch sizes, and network architecture

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Rust (Edition 2018)
- **Deep Learning**: Alumina framework v0.3.0
- **Image Processing**: image crate v0.19
- **Linear Algebra**: ndarray v0.11.2
- **CLI**: clap v2
- **Serialization**: serde, bincode
- **Compression**: xz2

## Progress Log

### Session 1 - Initial Setup, Error Handling, and Testing
- ✅ Analyzed project structure and dependencies
- ✅ Created comprehensive todo list
- ✅ Created project_description.md
- ✅ Enhanced error handling module with new error types:
  - Added GraphExecution, CheckpointSave, InvalidInput, ShapeError, MissingFolder errors
  - Improved error conversions for bincode, parsing errors
- ✅ Replaced unwrap() and expect() calls with proper error handling in:
  - training/data_loader.rs (create_prescaled_training_stream now returns Result)
  - training/trainer_simple.rs (improved checkpoint saving error handling)
  - lib.rs (fixed graph execution error handling)
  - aligned_crop.rs (better error messages)
  - commands/train_prescaled.rs (added PathBuf import, fixed validation stream)
- ✅ Created unit tests:
  - error_tests.rs: Tests for error conversions and display
  - config_tests.rs: Tests for NetworkConfig and TrainingConfig validation
  - psnr_tests.rs: Tests for PSNR calculation functionality
- ✅ Created integration tests:
  - integration_tests.rs: CLI command tests for help, validation, and error handling
- ✅ All tests passing successfully

### Session 2 - CI/CD, Validation, Documentation, and Infrastructure
- ✅ Implemented CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions:
  - ci.yml: Multi-platform testing, code coverage, security audit
  - release.yml: Automated release builds for Linux, Windows, macOS
- ✅ Added comprehensive input validation module:
  - validation.rs: File path validation, image extension checks, parameter validation
  - Integrated validation into upscale, downscale, and train commands
- ✅ Improved documentation:
  - Created USAGE.md with detailed usage guide and examples
  - Updated README.md with better structure and features list
- ✅ Created Docker infrastructure:
  - Dockerfile: Multi-stage build for optimized image size
  - docker-compose.yml: Services for batch processing and training
  - .dockerignore: Optimize build context
- ✅ Implemented logging system:
  - logging.rs: Progress bars, spinners, training metrics
  - Integrated with main.rs and upscale command
  - Added log, env_logger, indicatif, chrono dependencies

## Summary of Improvements
