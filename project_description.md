- **Pre-trained Models**: Includes natural and anime-specific models
- **Custom Training**: Ability to train new models on custom datasets
- **Multiple Commands**: Support for training, upscaling, downscaling, PSNR calculation, and more
- **Flexible Parameters**: Configurable learning rates, batch sizes, patch sizes, and network architecture

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Rust (Edition 2018)
- **Deep Learning**: Alumina framework v0.3.0
- **Image Processing**: image crate v0.19
- **Linear Algebra**: ndarray v0.11.2
