# SRGAN-Rust Project Description

## Project Overview
SRGAN-Rust is a Rust implementation of Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGAN) for image upscaling using deep learning. The project provides both pre-trained neural networks for immediate use and the ability to train custom networks on specialized datasets.

## Current Features
- **Image Upscaling**: Uses neural networks to upscale low-resolution images to high-resolution
- **Pre-trained Models**: Includes natural and anime-specific models
- **Custom Training**: Ability to train new models on custom datasets
- **Multiple Commands**: Support for training, upscaling, downscaling, PSNR calculation, and more
- **Flexible Parameters**: Configurable learning rates, batch sizes, patch sizes, and network architecture

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Rust (Edition 2018)
- **Deep Learning**: Alumina framework v0.3.0
- **Image Processing**: image crate v0.19
- **Linear Algebra**: ndarray v0.11.2
- **CLI**: clap v2
- **Serialization**: serde, bincode
- **Compression**: xz2

## Development Todo List

### Completed Tasks
✅ Create project_description.md with project overview

### In Progress Tasks
None currently

### Pending Tasks

#### High Priority - Core Functionality
1. **Add comprehensive error handling throughout the codebase** - Improve error messages and recovery
2. **Create unit tests for core functionality** - Test network operations, data loading, and transformations
3. **Add integration tests for CLI commands** - Test all command-line operations end-to-end
4. **Add input validation for all CLI commands** - Validate file paths, parameters, and ranges

#### Medium Priority - Infrastructure
5. **Implement CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions** - Automate testing and releases
6. **Implement proper logging system** - Add configurable logging levels and output
7. **Create Docker container for easy deployment** - Containerize the application
8. **Add configuration file support for training parameters** - YAML/TOML config files

#### Low Priority - Enhancements
9. **Improve documentation with usage examples** - Add more detailed examples and tutorials
10. **Add progress bars for long-running operations** - Visual feedback during training/processing
11. **Add benchmarking capabilities** - Performance metrics and comparisons
12. **Add support for batch processing multiple images** - Process entire directories
13. **Implement GPU acceleration support** - CUDA/OpenCL integration
14. **Create example training datasets and documentation** - Sample datasets with guides

## Progress Log

### Session 1 - Initial Setup, Error Handling, and Testing
- ✅ Analyzed project structure and dependencies
- ✅ Created comprehensive todo list
- ✅ Created project_description.md
- ✅ Enhanced error handling module with new error types:
  - Added GraphExecution, CheckpointSave, InvalidInput, ShapeError, MissingFolder errors
  - Improved error conversions for bincode, parsing errors
- ✅ Replaced unwrap() and expect() calls with proper error handling in:
  - training/data_loader.rs (create_prescaled_training_stream now returns Result)
  - training/trainer_simple.rs (improved checkpoint saving error handling)
  - lib.rs (fixed graph execution error handling)
  - aligned_crop.rs (better error messages)
  - commands/train_prescaled.rs (added PathBuf import, fixed validation stream)
- ✅ Created unit tests:
  - error_tests.rs: Tests for error conversions and display
  - config_tests.rs: Tests for NetworkConfig and TrainingConfig validation
  - psnr_tests.rs: Tests for PSNR calculation functionality
- ✅ Created integration tests:
  - integration_tests.rs: CLI command tests for help, validation, and error handling
- ✅ All tests passing successfully
